<h3 class="h5">Summary</h3>
<p class="card-text">This paper introduces a novel approach to distributed stochastic optimization by employing a Self-Repellent Random Walk (SRRW) to enhance the convergence rates of optimization algorithms driven by stochastic approximations. Unlike conventional methods that utilize linear Markov chains, the proposed SRRW, which reduces the likelihood of revisiting frequently visited states, significantly decreases asymptotic variance in gradient sampling. The authors prove that their SA-SRRW algorithm converges to zero optimization error almost surely, demonstrating a clear performance advantage over traditional methods, particularly in decentralized learning environments. Empirical results validate the theoretical claims, showing superior performance of the SRRW-driven algorithms across various scenarios, emphasizing the benefits of employing non-linear Markov chains in stochastic optimization contexts.</p>

<h3 class="h5">Summary</h3>
<p class="card-text">This paper presents Fast Low-Rank Adaptation (FLORA), a novel framework that enhances Low-Rank Adaptation (LORA) for efficiently adapting foundation models in real-time serving scenarios. While LORA has been effective in reducing the number of trainable parameters by employing low-rank matrices, it struggles with batching multiple requests that require distinct task-specific adaptations. FLORA addresses this limitation by allowing each input in a minibatch to use unique low-rank adaptation weights, thereby improving throughput and reducing latency without sacrificing accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate FLORA's advantages over LORA in multilingual code generation and speech recognition tasks, highlighting its potential for real-world applications requiring diverse and personalized model adaptations.</p>

<h3 class="h5">Summary</h3>
<p class="card-text">This paper presents a comprehensive study on summarizing book-length texts using large language models (LLMs), addressing the challenges posed by their limited context window size. It introduces a systematic evaluation framework to assess coherence in LLM-generated summaries, validated through 1193 human annotations on summaries from 100 recently published books. The authors develop an automatic metric called BOOOOK SCORE, which successfully measures coherence by identifying common error types in summaries and demonstrates high agreement with human evaluations. The study finds that summarization strategies such as hierarchical merging yield more coherent summaries but at the cost of detail, while incremental updating offers richer detail but may reduce coherence. The results indicate that closed-source models like GPT-4 outperform open-source counterparts, and the findings aim to advance research in book-length summarization by releasing both the metric and annotated data for further exploration.</p>

<p class="card-text">This paper introduces a novel task called Candidate Label Set Pruning (CLSP) within the framework of Partial-Label Learning (PLL), shifting the focus from traditional learning-centric methods to a data-centric perspective. The authors propose a training-free CLSP method that aims to filter out potential false candidate labels based on the inconsistency between the representation space and the candidate label space. By utilizing a per-example pruning scheme derived from k-nearest neighbor instances, the method effectively reduces the size of candidate label sets, thus enhancing the performance of existing deep PLL methods. Theoretical analyses establish an upper bound on pruning error rates, while extensive empirical evaluations on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of deep PLL methods, validating the efficacy of the proposed CLSP approach.</p>

They also introduce an explainable approach to highlight the significance of individual tokens in the memorization process, enabling users to adjust their prompts accordingly. Furthermore, two mitigation strategies are proposed: one for inference that minimizes text-conditional prediction magnitudes and another for training that filters out potential memorized examples. These methods effectively reduce memorization while maintaining the quality of generated outputs, providing a comprehensive solution to mitigate the risks associated with diffusion model memorization.</p>

<h3 class="h5">Summary</h3>
<p class="card-text">This paper introduces Efficient Episodic Memory Utilization (EMU) for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), addressing challenges such as long convergence times and local optima in complex tasks. EMU enhances learning efficiency through a trainable semantic memory embedding that enables coherent memory recall and an episodic incentive that promotes desirable state transitions. By leveraging these components, EMU significantly improves performance over traditional MARL methods, as demonstrated in experiments on challenging environments like StarCraft II and Google Research Football. The proposed framework allows for better exploration of promising state spaces and effectively mitigates the risk of local convergence, presenting a strong advancement in MARL methodologies.</p>

<p class="card-text">The paper introduces ExeDec, a novel decomposition-based strategy for enhancing compositional generalization in neural program synthesis. It highlights the importance of breaking down complex programming tasks into simpler subtasks, akin to human programmers' approach. The authors establish a meta-benchmark comprising five distinct forms of compositional generalization, and through experiments on datasets like RobustFill and DeepCoder, they demonstrate that ExeDec significantly improves synthesis performance and generalization capabilities over existing baseline methods. Additionally, the research reveals that large language models (LLMs) struggle with compositional generalization in programming tasks but can benefit from an ExeDec-inspired prompting approach, further emphasizing the potential of systematic decomposition in program synthesis.</p>

<p class="card-text">This paper investigates the safety risks associated with fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), specifically Meta's Llama-2 and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, revealing that customization through fine-tuning can significantly compromise their safety alignment. Through red teaming studies, the authors demonstrate that even a small number of adversarially designed training examples can lead to the models being "jailbroken," allowing harmful instructions to be executed. Alarmingly, they also find that benign datasets can inadvertently degrade the models' safety, highlighting a critical gap in existing safety protocols. The study emphasizes the need for improved mitigation strategies, combining technical and policy measures, to reinforce safety during the fine-tuning process, urging further research to address these vulnerabilities effectively.</p>

<p class="card-text">The paper introduces Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM), a novel framework for training continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) on Riemannian manifolds, addressing limitations of existing generative modeling techniques that often require expensive simulations and struggle with high-dimensional data. RFM is distinguished by its simulation-free approach on simple geometries, closed-form computation of target vector fields, and lack of divergence requirements, making it efficient for various datasets. The methodology employs a premetric to define target vector fields and utilizes spectral decompositions for real-time computation on general geometries. Experimental results demonstrate that RFM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple non-Euclidean datasets, facilitating scalable training even on complex manifolds with non-trivial curvature and boundaries.</p>

The authors introduce a novel Causal Dropout Model that characterizes these dropout mechanisms and presents a theoretical result showing that conditional independence relations remain intact when samples with zeros for conditioned variables are excluded. This insight leads to a systematic approach for GRN inference that integrates seamlessly with existing causal discovery algorithms, ensuring asymptotic correctness.

<h3 class="h5">Summary</h3>
<p class="card-text">This paper investigates how deep neural networks (DNNs) used in score-based reverse diffusion processes for image denoising exhibit strong generalization capabilities, particularly when trained on large datasets. The authors demonstrate that as the training set size increases, DNNs trained on non-overlapping subsets of data learn nearly identical score functions, leading to high-quality image generation that does not merely memorize training samples. The study identifies that these networks perform a shrinkage operation in geometry-adaptive harmonic bases (GAHBs), which adapt to the underlying image structure and enhance denoising performance. This relationship between denoising and density estimation reveals that DNN inductive biases align well with the data distribution, enabling effective learning from relatively small training sets and confirming the significance of GAHBs in achieving optimal denoising outcomes.</p>

<p class="card-text">This paper investigates the CLIP image encoder by decomposing its representation into contributions from individual image patches, model layers, and attention heads. The authors develop a method called TEXTSPAN to characterize the roles of attention heads based on text representations, revealing property-specific functions such as shape detection and spatial localization. The study shows that understanding these components allows for improved model performance, as demonstrated through applications that reduce spurious correlations in classification tasks and enhance zero-shot segmentation capabilities, suggesting that a scalable understanding of transformer models can lead to more effective and robust AI systems.</p>

<p class="card-text">This paper presents a novel approach to self-supervised learning by introducing a new dataset, the Walking Tours dataset, comprising high-resolution, continuous first-person videos and a tailored pretraining method called DORA (Discover and Track Objects). The dataset contains 10 long, unlabeled videos capturing diverse urban scenes, which are argued to be more efficient for training image encoders than traditional image datasets like ImageNet. DORA incorporates implicit multi-object tracking through a transformer model, significantly enhancing the ability to learn robust visual representations from video data. Experimental results show that models pretrained on a single Walking Tours video achieve performance comparable to those trained on extensive image datasets across various downstream tasks, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging continuous video for self-supervised learning.</p>

<h3 class="h5">Summary</h3>
<p class="card-text">The paper presents KNOWLEDGE CARD, a modular framework designed to enhance large language models (LLMs) by filling knowledge gaps through the integration of specialized language models, termed "knowledge cards." These knowledge cards, trained on diverse domain-specific corpora, act as parametric repositories that provide relevant, factual, and up-to-date information during LLM inference. The framework employs three content selectors to ensure quality by controlling relevance, brevity, and factual accuracy of the knowledge integrated. TWO approaches, bottom-up and top-down, are proposed for knowledge integration, allowing for dynamic synthesis of information from various sources while maintaining modularity and facilitating collaborative contributions from the research community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KNOWLEDGE CARD significantly outperforms existing LLMs and retrieval-augmented models across multiple tasks, showcasing its ability to enhance LLM performance in knowledge-intensive contexts.</p>

<p class="card-text">The paper presents a novel method, SDE-EDG, to address the challenges of Evolving Domain Generalization (EDG) in machine learning, particularly in scenarios where distribution shifts occur over time. Existing EDG methods struggle with limited timestamps, leading to overfitting and poor generalization to unseen domains. To overcome this, the authors introduce the Infinitely Fined-Grid Evolving Trajectory (IFGET) that utilizes continuous-interpolated samples to fill temporal gaps between timestamps. They leverage Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model and align these trajectories, capturing evolving patterns in the data. The approach is empirically validated on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, thereby enhancing adaptability and generalization in time-varying environments.</p>

By constructing a submodular function that incorporates four constraints—confidence, effectiveness, consistency, and collaboration scores—the proposed method effectively identifies important regions in images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets (Celeb-A, VGG-Face2, and CUB-200-2011) by significantly improving attribution scores for both correctly and incorrectly predicted samples, thereby providing clearer explanations for model decisions.</p>

<h3 class="h5">Summary</h3>
<p class="card-text">The paper introduces Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA), a novel unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) approach aimed at addressing the scalability challenges posed by complex, high-dimensional environments. Unlike previous methods that either rely on exhaustive exploration or mutual information skill learning, METRA focuses on covering a compact latent space that connects to the state space through temporal distances. This enables the discovery of diverse, useful behaviors, even in pixel-based environments such as Quadruped and Humanoid. The experimental results demonstrate that METRA successfully learns locomotion skills and achieves superior state coverage compared to existing unsupervised RL methods, establishing itself as the first method to effectively discover such behaviors in challenging pixel-based settings.</p>

<p class="card-text">The paper presents Norton, a novel framework for addressing the challenges of learning long-term temporal dependencies in video-language tasks, particularly in the context of noisy correspondence between video clips and captions. Existing methods primarily focus on short clips, neglecting the complexities introduced by long videos, which often suffer from multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC) issues, including coarse-grained clip-caption misalignments and fine-grained frame-word mismatches. Norton employs a unified optimal transport approach that incorporates video-paragraph and clip-caption contrastive losses to effectively capture long-term dependencies while mitigating MNC. Key innovations include an alignable prompt bucket for filtering irrelevant clips and captions, a soft-maximum operator for fine-grained alignment, and strategies to exploit faulty negatives in contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Norton across various tasks, including video retrieval and action segmentation, highlighting its robustness and computational efficiency in learning from long-term videos.</p>

<p class="card-text">This paper investigates the impact of self-pretraining (SPT) on the performance of long-sequence models, particularly Transformers and state space models (SSMs), in capturing long-range dependencies. The authors reveal that training from random initialization leads to an overestimation of performance differences between architectures. Through empirical studies using the Long Range Arena benchmark, they demonstrate that SPT significantly enhances the performance of vanilla Transformers and S4 models, allowing them to achieve competitive results without architectural modifications. Their findings suggest that data-driven priors from SPT can replace complex hand-crafted biases, highlighting the necessity of incorporating pretraining for accurate evaluation of model capabilities in long-sequence tasks.</p>

<p class="card-text">The paper introduces Pre-Training Goal-Based Models (PTGM) to enhance sample efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL) by pre-training goal-conditioned policies on large, task-agnostic datasets. PTGM employs a hierarchical approach where a low-level policy is pre-trained to execute goals, while a high-level policy generates these goals during RL tasks. The method addresses high-dimensional goal spaces through clustering, creating a discrete action space, and utilizes a pre-trained goal prior model to regularize high-level policy behavior, thereby improving exploration and learning stability. Experimental results in robotic simulations and the Minecraft environment demonstrate that PTGM significantly outperforms existing methods in sample efficiency and task performance, while also improving the interpretability and generalization of learned low-level skills.</p>

<p class="card-text">This paper investigates the conditions under which object-centric representations learned by autoencoders can achieve compositional generalization, which is the capacity to apply learned knowledge to novel combinations of known concepts. The authors address the theoretical and empirical gaps in understanding when compositional generalization is guaranteed, employing identifiability theory to prove that autoencoders with specific structural assumptions on their decoders can learn representations that generalize compositionally. They introduce two key properties—additivity of the decoder and compositional consistency of the encoder—which together ensure that the model can accurately identify and reconstruct unseen combinations of objects. Experiments demonstrate that enforcing these properties allows the model to generalize effectively, thus laying a foundation for future work in robust machine perception.</p>

<h3 class="h5">Summary</h3>
<p class="card-text">This paper introduces a novel statistical test for identifying test set contamination in black box language models without needing access to their training data or weights. By leveraging the concept of exchangeability, the authors demonstrate that if a language model shows a preference for a specific ordering of a benchmark dataset, this indicates potential contamination. They develop a sharded likelihood comparison test that compares the log probabilities of the canonical ordering against shuffled examples, providing guarantees on false positive rates. The test is shown to be effective in detecting contamination even with small datasets and lower duplication counts, and the authors audit four popular language models, finding little evidence of pervasive contamination. Ultimately, this work paves the way for robust third-party audits of language models regarding dataset contamination.</p>

<p class="card-text">This paper argues for the reinstatement of the ReLU activation function in large language models (LLMs) to enhance computational efficiency during inference, especially for resource-constrained devices. The authors demonstrate that using ReLU minimally impacts model performance while significantly reducing computation demands—up to three times less—due to increased activation sparsity. By fine-tuning existing models previously trained with other activation functions like GELU or SiLU, the authors find that performance can be rapidly restored. Furthermore, they explore innovative applications of activation sparsity for token generation speed and propose the shifted ReLU activation variant to enhance sparsity without sacrificing performance. Overall, the findings advocate for leveraging structured activation sparsity to improve the efficiency of LLMs.</p>

<p class="card-text">This paper investigates the necessity of causal reasoning for agents to adapt robustly to new environments and tasks. It establishes that any agent capable of maintaining a low regret bound amidst various distributional shifts must have learned an approximate causal model of the underlying data-generating process. The authors present theoretical results demonstrating that such causal models are essential for effective transfer learning and causal inference. Additionally, they discuss implications for adaptive agents, suggesting that learning a causal representation may enhance an agent's generalization capabilities across different tasks. The findings reinforce the link between causal understanding and general intelligence, proposing that robust AI systems inherently require causal world models.</p>

<h3 class="h5">Summary</h3>
<p class="card-text">The paper presents a novel method called "instruction backtranslation" for enhancing instruction-following capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled web data. Instead of relying on extensive human-annotated datasets, the approach utilizes a finetuned seed model to generate potential instruction-output pairs from unlabelled text, which are then curated for quality through iterative self-training. This self-augmentation and self-curation process significantly improves the model's performance, as demonstrated by achieving state-of-the-art results on the Alpaca leaderboard without using distillation data. The findings suggest that high-quality, self-generated instruction data can effectively align LLMs to follow instructions while reducing the dependence on human annotation.</p>

<p class="card-text">The paper introduces Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SELF-RAG), a novel framework designed to enhance the quality and factual accuracy of large language models (LLMs) by integrating on-demand retrieval and self-reflection mechanisms. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods that retrieve a fixed number of passages indiscriminately, SELF-RAG employs a flexible approach where the model determines the necessity of retrieval, processes relevant passages, and generates special reflection tokens to critique its own outputs. This adaptive generation process allows for improved factuality and citation accuracy across various tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs like ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat in diverse evaluations. The framework demonstrates significant advantages in performance while maintaining the versatility of the LLM, making it a promising advancement in addressing the factual shortcomings of previous models.</p>

<p class="card-text">This paper investigates the training instabilities encountered when scaling Transformer-based models, focusing on reproducing and understanding these issues at smaller scales. The authors identify two main sources of instability—the growth of logits in attention layers and output logit divergence—and demonstrate that these instabilities can also manifest in small models when trained at high learning rates. They introduce the concept of learning rate (LR) sensitivity as a metric to analyze the relationship between learning rate and loss, revealing that certain mitigations previously effective at large scales, such as qk-layernorm and z-loss regularization, are similarly beneficial for smaller models. Additionally, the study explores various optimizer and model interventions, finding that methods like warm-up and independent weight decay can help reduce LR sensitivity. The findings suggest that small-scale models offer valuable insights into training stability, enabling the prediction of instabilities and highlighting new issues that may arise with scaling.</p>

<p class="card-text">This paper presents a novel algorithm for K-means clustering that combines the simplicity and scalability of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the strong statistical guarantees provided by semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. The proposed method employs a nonnegative low-rank factorization approach, optimized through a primal-dual gradient descent algorithm. This allows it to maintain the computational efficiency of NMF while achieving the same level of statistical optimality as SDP, which is traditionally inaccessible for large datasets due to its high computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that the new algorithm significantly reduces mis-clustering errors compared to existing state-of-the-art methods while remaining scalable for practical applications.</p>

<h3 class="h5">Summary</h3>
<p class="card-text">This paper investigates the mechanisms underlying in-context learning (ICL) in transformer models, specifically focusing on how data distributional properties influence the emergence of abrupt learning transitions. The authors demonstrate that ICL, which allows models to predict responses based on contextual examples without weight updates, is driven by the formation of an induction head in the model's architecture. Through both empirical experiments and a minimal two-parameter model of the induction head, they reveal that specific distributional features, such as burstiness and rank-frequency distributions, enhance ICL while simultaneously constraining in-weights learning (IWL). The study concludes that the abrupt learning transitions observed in ICL can be attributed to a series of nested logits that create sharp gradients in the loss landscape, highlighting the complex interplay between data characteristics and the architecture of attention-based networks.</p>

<p class="card-text">This paper presents NISQ-TDA, a novel quantum algorithm designed for estimating Betti numbers in topological data analysis (TDA) on noisy quantum computers. Unlike classical TDA methods, which are computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional data, NISQ-TDA operates efficiently on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices without the need for fault tolerance. The algorithm leverages a short circuit-depth and avoids the data-loading problem by processing input data dynamically. Empirical results demonstrate its robustness against noise, suggesting its potential as a useful tool for machine learning and scientific applications in analyzing complex datasets.

<p class="card-text">This paper critically evaluates the efficacy of postprocessing methods for achieving algorithmic fairness, specifically focusing on equalizing error rates across demographic groups. Through an extensive empirical study involving over 11,000 model evaluations on various tabular datasets, the authors demonstrate that postprocessing consistently dominates other fairness intervention methods in terms of the fairness-accuracy Pareto frontier. They introduce a novel concept termed "unprocessing," which allows for a fair comparison of different fairness methods by mapping fairness-constrained models back to their unconstrained counterparts. The findings indicate that the simplest postprocessing approach remains optimal for achieving error rate parity, challenging the assumption that more complex methods yield better outcomes.</p>

<p class="card-text">The paper presents a systematic framework, termed ValUES, for the validation of uncertainty estimation methods in semantic segmentation, addressing the significant gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications. It identifies key pitfalls in the current literature regarding the separation and evaluation of aleatoric (AU) and epistemic uncertainty (EU), proposing a controlled environment for studying data ambiguities and distribution shifts. The framework allows for systematic ablations of uncertainty method components and evaluates their effectiveness across five predominant applications: out-of-distribution detection, active learning, failure detection, calibration, and ambiguity modeling. Empirical studies reveal that while AU and EU can be theoretically separated, this often does not translate to real-world scenarios, highlighting the importance of method components, particularly aggregation strategies, in determining the performance of uncertainty methods. The findings offer practical recommendations for researchers and practitioners in the field.</p>

<h3 class="h5">Summary</h3>
<p class="card-text">The paper introduces Wurstchen, an innovative architecture for text-to-image synthesis that significantly enhances computational efficiency while maintaining competitive image quality. By employing a three-stage process, Wurstchen utilizes a latent diffusion technique that generates a highly compressed semantic image representation to guide the diffusion process, resulting in a drastic reduction in training hours—from 200,000 hours for Stable Diffusion 2.1 to approximately 24,602 hours for Wurstchen—while also achieving superior image quality. The model's architecture decouples text-conditional generation from high-resolution image projection, allowing for faster inference and a smaller carbon footprint. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Wurstchen not only matches the performance of existing state-of-the-art models but also excels in user preference studies, highlighting its potential for democratizing high-quality image generation.</p>

<h3 class="h5">Summary</h3>
<p class="card-text">The paper presents Zipformer, a novel encoder model designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) that improves upon the Conformer architecture by enhancing speed, memory efficiency, and performance. Key innovations include a U-Net-like encoder structure with variable frame rates, a redesigned block structure that reuses attention weights, a new normalization technique called BiasNorm, and the introduction of two new activation functions, SwooshR and SwooshL. Additionally, a parameter-scale-invariant optimizer named ScaledAdam is proposed, which enhances convergence speed and model performance. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including LibriSpeech, Aishell-1, and WenetSpeech, confirm that Zipformer achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating significant improvements in both efficiency and recognition accuracy compared to existing models.</p>
